		I had ox tail soup the other day.  Actually, I had oxtail soup yesterday for lunch.  I am not really sure whether oxtail soup was created in a developing country or if it was conceived in developed countries.  I have never actually ordered it from a restaurant in a developing country or a restaurant in a developed country.  If you don't know what a developing country or a developed country is, then you've probably eaten a bell pepper once.  I don't know if that's fortunate or unfortunate.  Anyways, I have always either made oxtail soup myself or eaten the oxtail soup that my mom made me.  Back to Ox, the artist.  Ox is not bad, but I keep getting choked up on Ox's surroundings.  They're so shitty.</br></br>
		Ox is from France, but I thought Ox was from the hood in some God forsaken world.  (Eat your vegetables children because if you don't you get sent to places where Ox lives or Australia.)  Ox, I like how you plastered wet paper on walls.  Let me not be sarcastic for a moment.  Ox, some of your work is cool, but it's like the green shirt that I wear with the pocket, the one I never really wear in public, it's not a v neck, and it's comfortable; it's something I wear infront of my mom and she doesn't give a shit about. </br></br>
		People, if Ox is on any sort of list or is famed in this world, you can be a better woman, man, child, or professional.  Look at Ox, lives in a mayonaise free Europe probably sipping on gin and juice by the looks of the projects there (French apartments).</br>
