      	<h4>
        This concept was birthed out of wanting to help underpriveledged kids in my local community, my neighborhoods, my city, my state, country, and my world.  I want a brand that everyone can wear, is proud to wear while looking fantastic.  As income inequality joins forces with high fashion brands.. let's just call this a people's union in response.  Salvador Ferragamo, Yves Saint Laurent, Pigalle, Lanvin, Dsquared, Comme Des Garcon you people are good, but we aren't stupid and we are coming for you.  We can talk about who runs the world, but then we would have to talk about a French Revolution, an Arab Spring, a Kiev Riot, Korean Democracy, a Haitian Nation, etc. Oh yeah, also, if you need to make money by copying/selling Jueles Mayflower branded clothes, then go ahead, just don't get too rich with out us or else at that point we'll sue.  Other than that, let's make it look good.
